# Estimaing-used-car-prices
It is still an ongoing project. In this project I'm using various DATA WRANGLING and DATA ANALYSIS techniques to explore them and finding various correlations so that I can tame my data and evaluate models
Data is briefly examined by various plots and maps to find the correlation.
Using techniques for testing like ANOVA for group dependencies etc.
Model Development process is still in development phase so it is an ongoing project.
Will add more details once I complete the model development phase and will conclude this project.

 Project cum tutorial for Exploratory Data Analysis and Model evaluation (Linear regression,Multiple linear regression, Polynomial linear regression and Ridge regression)
 In this project I'm using various DATA WRANGLING and DATA ANALYSIS techniques to explore and finding various correlations so that I can tame my data and evaluate models and find the model which fits
Using techniques for testing like ANOVA, Pearson correlation etc for group dependencies.
Comparision of errors is shown so as to gain an insight about how errors are found and handled.
Modeles used are Linear, Multiple linear, Polynomial and Ridge regression.
